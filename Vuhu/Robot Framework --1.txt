Helpful TIPS:
1. Always install wxPython before installing RIDE.  
    wxPython is a wrapper for getting the GUI of RIDE. 
    So it is important to install wxPython before you install RIDE

2. Always check your python version and install wxPython for the same version
     ***32 bit - check your python ver by running command python and install same bit     wxpython

3. pip cache folder is located at - C:\Users\Vikas\AppData\Local\pip\cache
            If you uninstall a lib and install it again, it will use the zip from cache. 
            to install fresh 
                - you can empty contents of cache folder
                - pip install --no-cache-dir robotframework-ride

4. Versions prior to Robot Framework 3.0 did not have the robot script. Instead they       had pybot, jybot and ipybot scripts that executed tests using Python, Jython and       IronPython, respectively. These scripts are still installed, but the plan is to deprecate     and remove them in the future.
